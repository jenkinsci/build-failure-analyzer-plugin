<div>
    <p>A <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum" target="_blank">regular
        expression</a> to find in the build log.</p>
    <p>The regular expression should match the entire line, so if you are looking for FATAL first in the line
        but don't know what comes after it, your expression should be ^FATAL.*</p>
    <p>Substitutions may be made within the description with placeholders of the form <code>${I,G}</code>, where
        <code>I</code> is the indication number and <code>G</code> is the captured group within the indication
        expression. e.g., <code>${1,1}</code> would be replaced with the first indication's first captured group
        and <code>${1,2}</code> would be replaced with the first indication's second captured group.</p>
