    <p>A <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum" target="_blank">regular expression</a> to find in the build log.</p>
    <p>Note that you should not specify ".*" within your multi-line pattern unless you actually want to match every character. ".*FOO.*" will match the entire build log, assuming it contains "FOO" somewhere.
