<div>
    <p>A <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum" target="_blank">regular
        expression</a> to find in the build log.</p>
    <p>Note that you should not specify ".*" within your multi-line pattern unless you actually want to match every
        character. ".*FOO.*" will match the entire build log, assuming it contains "FOO" somewhere.</p>
    <p>Substitutions may be made within the description with placeholders of the form <code>${I,G}</code>, where
        <code>I</code> is the indication number and <code>G</code> is the captured group within the indication
        expression. e.g., <code>${1,1}</code> would be replaced with the first indication's first captured group
        and <code>${1,2}</code> would be replaced with the first indication's second captured group.</p>
